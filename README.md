# Dockerfile for Salt Master

# Installation
Following https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap/tree/v2014.10.30

# Configuring Salt Master
Salt master listens on default ports:  ["4505","4506", "443"]
Default LOG_LEVEL is "error", you can change to "info" for more verbose
# Notes
At the moment, -M option does not work as expected as we installed from git.
